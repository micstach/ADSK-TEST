# TEST-TEST

1. Run through one of favorite Forge Quick Start samples available on here: https://developer.autodesk.com/en/docs/quickstarts/v1/overview/

2. Create, design (describe tools/frameworks) simple nodejs service that handle single REST Request:
 ```
 GET: /add/:x/:y
 ```
 and retuns the sum of two numbers `x` and `y` (simple text response)
 
 Dockerize this application
 
 Key problem here is to describe possible testing scenarios for that service/application
